About
-----
debug.sh is a small script I use to build, manage and deploy my projects
from the command line.

Originally I simply used it to automate a few lines of something like
'ant debug && adb install' but eventually got round to adding some more
options.

I may change the name to something more inspired but am so used at this
stage to running ./debug.sh that it would annoy me to change it!

Usage
-----
The usage message should be fairly self explanitory, the only part that
you will need to change are *_CMD env variables.

The ones there at the moment are examples of what I currently use to run 
builds on my build machine.  A more standard case would be to add something 
like the following to your bashrc:

export BUILD_CMD="ant debug"
export CLEAN_CMD="ant clean"
export INSTALL_CMD="adb install -r bin/<my-app>-debug.apk"
export UNINSTALL_CMD="adb uninstall <my-package>"
