About
-----
debug.sh is a small script I use to build, manage and deploy my android
projects from the command line, without Eclipse.

Originally I simply used it to automate a few lines of something like
'ant debug && adb install' but eventually got round to adding some more
options.

I may change the name to something more inspired but am so used at this
stage to running ./debug.sh that it would annoy me to change it!

Usage
-----
Recommended way is add a simple environment file to your project that looks
something like the following:

export PKG_NAME="com.bourke.roidrage"
export INSTALL_CMD="adb install -r bin/RoidRage-debug.apk"

Then when you open a shell just source the above:

$ source debug.env

Building, re-installing and launching your project is now as easy as:

$ ./debug.sh -xa <Activity>


Most commands used can be overridden, have a look at the usage message or
browse through the script for more info.
